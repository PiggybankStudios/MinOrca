# Minimal Orca Application
This is the repository where I test using Orca with minimal dependencies or reliance on my existing code. This means some subset of GyLib, where anything provided by the Orca runtime is preferred over my own types/functions, but maybe with some extra extensions/aliases to try and bring Orca naming conventions and feature set closer to what I'm used to

## Porca
The opposite approach is explored in https://github.com/PiggybankStudios/Porca where I try and rely more on my own code rather than the Orca runtime, with the goal to eventually use Orca as a platform for Pig Engine
